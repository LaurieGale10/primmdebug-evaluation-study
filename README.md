# PRIMMDebug Research Study: Log Data Analysis

A repository containing the analysis code for the log data gathered from secondary students in an initial research study of [PRIMMDebug](http://primmdebug.web.app).

The log data gives information on the actions students' performed within the tool, including the responses they wrote, run-by-run logs of the programs they edited, and more granular data such as inspection of certain UI elements. For more detail on logging, view the [`logging.service.ts`](https://github.com/LaurieGale10/primmdebug/blob/main/src/app/services/logging.service.ts) of the PRIMMDebug repository. This analysis aims to use this data to investigate the efficacy of the tool and students' initial interactions with it.

The analysis (and the study) is currently a <ins>work-in-progress</ins>. As a result, the data has not yet been posted to this repository. This will be made publicly available by September 2025, with analysis completing before then.

In the meantime you can view the overall structure of the analysis in `main.ipynb`.
