Given the study's focus on reflective debugging, we decided to cluster based on the time spent on each PRIMMDebug stage. Then, the success, quality of written responses, and survey responses can be calculated to see any difference between the clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Procedure for clustering analysis was informed by Murphy et al., (2024), Everitt et al., (year) and Frades and Matthiesen (2010). As a result, a few options for each stage was selected in order that could in turn be compared and evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **What are we clustering**: Clustering for two main objects is being explored:\n",
    "  - Feature: Median time on PRIMMDebug stage.\n",
    "  - Item: PRIMMDebug challenge attempts\n",
    "  - Item: Students (with potential addition of number of challenges attempted)\n",
    "  - Both only contain continuous data.\n",
    "2. **How does the data need to be transformed**: Some general preprocessing will need to be performed on the data.\n",
    "  - Missing data: Check how much missing data there is (lots of challenge attempts won't get to the final stages - what to do about these? Labelling them as 0 will naturally influence the clusters). Check how much missing data there is.\n",
    "  - For the partioning methods, data will need to be standardised.\n",
    "  - Item-feature matrix also needs to be made for clustering\n",
    "3. **Similarity measure**: Trying a mix of methods that work solely with continuous data, namely Euclidean, Manhattan (more robust to outliers), Minkowski distance, and maybe Pearson?\n",
    "4. **Clustering algorithm**: Three clustering algorithms are being tried and compared: K-means, K-medoids, and agglomerative hierarchical clustering.\n",
    "5. **Evaluation of clusters**: Widely different solutions may indicate abscence of clusters based on current variables. Here's some metrics used, specifically based on (refs) and (refs):\n",
    "   - For cluster quality: Average Silhouette Width and silhouette plot can be used to determine whether each cluster is \"good\", as well as bootstrapping.\n",
    "   - For influence (of a single point): Point biserial index.\n",
    "Values for both measures range from -1-1.\n",
    "6. **Interpretation**: Inspect clusters and give them names\n",
    "\n",
    "Generate pairwise scatter plots to check for outliers, which should be removed accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
